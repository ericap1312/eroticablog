Lily grunts and looks at her spreadsheet on the computer screen. She has been in her home office since lunch, trying to solve this one bad problem. The results just don’t seem right, but it’s her job to make it right. She grunts again, this time louder as if someone in the other room can hear her. Her maid already left and her fiance, Jake, is still not home. The fact that he is late makes her even more grumpy. She would have been saved from all this stress if he had been home earlier. 



Stepping over some papers and scattered pencils on the floors, she makes her way to the kitchen for something to make her less grumpy. She finished cooking dinner a while ago, which is still in the oven staying warm. She is wandering through the dirty dishes, looking for the mug she uses this morning when the front door clicks. It opens slightly and Lily hears the familiar voice she has been waiting for. 



“Hey princess, I am home,” Jake pokes his head in, looking left and right and smiles at her in the kitchen. He stumbles his way in, kicking off his shoes and kick shut the door behind him. After putting his bag and a big box on the counter, he comes back to lock the door like he always does. All the while, Lily doesn’t say a word, just crosses her arms and stares at him.



“I am sorry, it was a little oopsie that I had to deal with,” Jake comes to comfort her, giving her a peck on her forehead. “Don’t be mad, I bought you some cake baby,” he points at the box on the counter. Lily just stays silent and makes her way back to her office. 



Back in the kitchen, Jake stares at the pile of dishes and quietly washes them. Lily can hear the shower starting shortly after. She is still mad even though she wants to hug him. He didn’t even text her that he was going to be late. It isn’t long until Jake shows up at the door, wearing only his boxer. His hair is still wet and there is just a towel hanging around his neck. It’s Lily’s weakness, she loves how fresh and cozy he looks fresh out of the shower. His strong shoulders flex as he leans on the door, looking all over her office. 



“Long day?”



“Yeh,” Lily replies, kicking herself and turning away from his body. He knows she loves it.



“I know baby, but what did we say about you drawing on the floor,” he turns his gaze at the scattered pencil.



Lily’s heart jumps as she remembers she has forgotten to clean up. 



“It's a fall hazard, you know that. We don’t want you to get hurt, don’t we?” 



“We are supposed to pick it up?” she says quietly, without looking up at him.



“Yes we are baby” she hears Jake heading to the desk, kicking away some pencils. “You seem to be grumpy today, I understand you had a hard day,” he kneels in front of her, looking at her face. “It’s okay it happens sometimes, but we need to have a little talk about your attitude, okay?”



She nods lightly. “Good,” Jake says as he puts his arm under her legs and picks her up. He carries her into the bedroom.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~



Lily pants as she tries to find out where Jake is in the room, or what he is getting. She is lying face down on the bed, with a blindfold on. The velvety material of the handcuffs is the only thing she could feel other than the wind on her skin. She must have laid there forever, listening to the sound of her fiance's footstep around the room. She can hear him opening some drawers, getting some things. Then suddenly, a hand on her thigh makes her yelp.



“It’s me, it’s me,” Jack chuckles, flipping her over. He lays her on some pillows to keep her up and some towels for easy cleaning. He slightly opens her legs, exposing her private. The cold wind makes Lily flinch already. Jake gives her another kiss on her forehead.



“Let me see. You did good today with your work I could tell, but you weren’t being very calm, were you? The dishes weren’t done after you made dinner, you didn't tell Mrs. Price to do it either. Then you left your drawing stuff all over the floor, even though it could have poke your feet.” Lily flinches at the feeling of leather on her feet.



“You seem really stressed today, and we really have to do something about it,” Jake starts moving the leather thing down her thighs, slightly pressing onto it. Then, a swoosh of wind flashes on her thigh and she can feel the sudden pain. It makes her yelp as Jake holds her legs down.



He flips her over on her stomach and positions her on his lap. He feels up her bare ass with his hands. His cold fingers running on her soft skin makes her squirm. Then, another whoosh. She yelps again, feeling his hand running over the whip marks.



“Do you know what you have done wrong baby?”



“Yes!” Lily yelps again as another whip slash on her ass. He feels him stop to caress the hurting spots.



“Don’t be grumpy like that again, just tell me” he whispers, running his fingers between her legs.



Lily’s inner folds meet his cold fingers, causing her body to quiver. She feels her damp part getting wetter the more he lingers near her cunt. Jake keeps running his finger up and down, feeling the heat radiating from her pussy. 



He slowly inserts a finger, only a little bit inside her. On his lap, Lily squirms and squeezes her thighs, trying hard to keep it in or else he will go back to spanking her. His finger goes back in, swerving up and down. The sound of her wet pussy starts echoing while Jake stays silent. Lily has no other options but squeezing her legs tight and arch her back every time he moves in. Then another whip, and he is back to spanking her.



She bittes her lips as his whip hits her thighs and ass until they feel like they are burning. Then he would run his cold fingers over them, making her legs shiver. It goes on for what seems like hours before she hears a slap and squirm so hard she falls off his lap. Jake slaps on her cunt from behind, with one arm holding down her hips. He quickly pulls her back up, and slap once more, making her fight her way out of his arms. 



He stops and Lily can feel his eyes on her, making her stop and calm down, just so he can slap it again. She feels her pussy burns at each hit and all she can do is scream into the mattress. He takes his time rubbing her spots this time. He goes from her thighs, up in between her legs and rubs quickly, sending shockwaves through her body. Lily feels like she is going to lose it to his rubs. 



He inserts his fingers back in, this time two of them. Only after a few strokes, he starts moving them rapidly, curving them toward her stomach. He inserts them faster and harder, moving them inside of her. She feels all sides of her walls being touched and rubbed. It sends her over the edge, her pussy starts throbbing and she moans loudly, letting him know she wants more. But then he stops, her building pleasure suddenly disappears and he is no longer touching her.



“Please, please,” she asks, turning left and right, she feels her body laying on the towel alone and Jake is nowhere near her. But she can hear his footsteps around the room. He picks something up from the bedside table. As soon as he gets back to bed, he rubs the silicon on her thighs and stomach.



“Is it a dildo? A buttt plug? A vibrator?” her head spins with curiosity but she just can’t guess from the material. She hears a click and yelps at the strong vibration on her skin. 



For the next long while, Jake pushes the wand all over her body, around her tits avoiding the nipples, down her stomach, along her thighs. He spins it around her inner thighs, watching her back arch everytime he comes too close. He toys with her until Lily feels cold sweat dripping down her neck. She has been holding it in for so long. He rubs the wand on her nipples, one by one, each time causing her to let out a loud moan. Her panting is getting faster, her nipples perk up sensitively after a couple touches of the wand. He chuckles at her legs quivering in the air as he moves the wand slowly up her inner thighs.



Jake starts kissing her, catching her off guard. She returns the kiss, slobbily, sticking her tongue out, waiting to get his kiss and tongue. But he just wants to distract her to push the wand hard on top of her clit. Lily lets out a scream and feels all the weight draining from her body. She squirts uncontrollably all over herself. The warm stream of her own cum covers her body up to her boobs, making her stomach churns.



Jake seems to get mad that she cums so fast, he pulls her legs together and up violently, and shoves the toy back on her clit. She squirms, trying to get away from his arms but she can’ hold it in and cums all over her fiance's shirt. Her body is cold and, at that point, all she could hear was her own whines. 



But he isn’t done with her, he pulls her so her pussy faces him, then shoves two fingers inside her pussy. She is still throbbing inside. With her legs wrapping around his neck, he fingers her hard, moving, curving and pulling. The sounds of his soaked fingers pushing in and out of her wet cunt echoes in the room. He grunts, watching her slightly opened mouth letting out his favorie sounds. 



“You promise to not be grumpy?” He bends down closer to her face.



“Yes, please daddy.” She screams, making his blood boil. He withdraws his fingers and starts rubbing her clit. He puts 4 fingers together to rub even harder. Lily lets out one final scream and cums all over herself. 



As he lets go of her, her body is still squirming in the aftermatch, glistening with her own cum. Her face is covered in sweat and saliva, he quietly stuffs his fingers in her mouth, watching her sucks and licks them clean before positioning her back to her side of the bed. He takes off the handcuffs, blindfold, towels and pulls a blanket over her before giving her a kiss goodnight.
