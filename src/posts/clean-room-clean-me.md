The smell of butter flowing in from the kitchen. The low humming and quiet noises of pots clattering. The light coming from Nathan’s windows wakes him up, forcing him to lay there and listen to all the jingly from outside his room.



Pulling himself up, he straightens his clothes, puts on a shirt and walks out. He wants to tell his roommate to quiet down a bit. She has quiet down enough but he needs to grieve his latest breakup, not to hear “Streets” at 8am. 



Chloe is taking out a baking sheet from the oven, and it smells heavenly, causing Nathan to realize he hasn’t eaten in a while. His stomach grumbles but as soon as he sees her, everything in his body grumbles. She was lounging around in her mini shorts. Her ass jiggles at Nathan, tempting him. As she stands up and turns around, Nathan catches sight of her bare boobs under her flimsy tank tops. It looks like she just woke up too, with her hair still messy and her clothes still more of an in-room clothes. She doesn’t notice Nathan standing, until he speaks up.



“You baking already?”



“Oh, yes, I was craving some cookies” she jumps, almost dropping her tray of cookies.



“I thought I smelled it from my room” Nathan looks away awkwardly as Chloe tries to cover up her chest.



“Yes, I didn’t expect you to be up so early. Do you want one?” she says, pointing to the tray.



“Yeh sure, I am a little hungry anyway, can I wait in my room?” 



“Of course, I will bring it in” she smiles as Nathan walks away from her.



Shutting the door behind him, Nathan plops on his bed and stare at the ceiling aimlessly. He has been in bed for so long, being sad, crying, like a whole mess. After his ex left, he has no energy left to even take care of himself. Maybe, that’s why his body is reacting so bad to his own roommate. He has known and loved Chloe for years since they met in class with the whole group and they all moved in together. But he doesn’t love her in “that '' context. 



A knock on the door makes Nathan jump. Then fear comes over him as he remembers Chloe is gonna have to see this horror as she gives him her fresh cookies. He sits up to the worst mess he has ever seen. There are Gatorade bottles all over the floor, there are piles of clothes, mixed with trash in some corners. The closet is empty because all the floor is on his desk, washed and unfolded. He doesn’t even remember washing his clothes.



“Hey, it’s your cookie delivery” she pokes her head in. She has been to her room and put a big hoodie on.



“Hey hey '' Nathan comes running to the door, covering the gap so she can’t look in. “Thank you so much” Nathan grabs the plate from her, sniffing the cookies and giving her a soft smile. “Smells like a good breakfast!”



“This? Oh no no, I will make you some eggs!” 



Ever since his breakup, no one has treated him so nicely. People just tell him to grieve and move on but he can’t eat raw hot dog for food all the time. He can hear the pots clattering again, as he eats his cookies, thinking about her kindness. 



“Hey Nate, it’s breakfast time!” he hears Chloe calling out for him. He aimlessly sat down at the island, smelling the buttery egg and toast in the making.



“The others left already, I will be home all day today though, if you need just about anything, let me know!” Chloe mumbles while she is setting up the piping hot plates. Then she turns around and bends down to grab some seasonings, her butt pokes out from under the oversized hoodies. She is still wearing the same shorts that show off her jiggles. Nathan can’t help but to feel overwhelmed, both with gratitude and horniness as he watches her giving him some breakfast. 



“So do you need help sorting out your post-breakup cave?’



“Oh….Uh….Yes?” Nathan mumbles. 



“Alrighty, let’s finish up and get to it” Chloe says cheerfully, grabbing her plates and throwing it in the sink. “I am going to grab the cleaning stuff, hurry up!”



Nathan watches in disbelief of what he just agreed to.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~



“It isn’t that bad” Nathan says shamefully.



“Yes, isn’t so bad…” Chloe nods. They have been staring at the mess for a while, not knowing where to start. Chloe just slowly picks up the stuff that looks like trash and Nathan follows suit. He helps her in whatever she decides to pick up. 



“Okay, this should go there,” she points at the top shelf of the closet, “now help me up?”



Nathan confusedly follows her orders and ends up picking her up from the waist and putting her on his shoulder. As he pushes her up, his hand runs across her juicy ass. The shorts are doing it again, her crack is right in front of his face. His thumbs are millimeters away from squeezing into all that juice. She has been working out lately as he can see her legs slightly muscular and thick as fuck. As he puts her on his shoulder, he can press the side of his face against her soft butt, feeling the tender muscle as well as the soft skin.



“Closer Nate” Chloe snaps him out of his thoughts. He takes a few steps into the closet. As he moves, he lays his hand on her lower hip, gripping onto her ass. It’s just as soft and tender as he has been imagining. All he needs is to be able to squeeze them butts. 



“Alright!” Chloe says, grabbing his shoulders with her hands. She turns her hips around and wraps her legs slightly around Nate’s body. With a little bounce, she starts sliding down Nathan’s body to get on her feet.



“Ohh ooops” she yells out in surprise.



“Yeah, oops” Nathan curses silently. His boner is so very visible through his sketchy basketball shorts. Guess he has been too busy thinking about her ass. It doesn’t help that Chloe is still gasping at the hard part poking out of his pants. She just stands then, in awe, looking very damn fuckable. “That didn’t help, yup” Nathan curses at himself as he feels his body gets hotter. 



He wants her to stop looking so awkwardly. So he grabs her chin and lifts her face up. She gives him a look, a look of irresistible cuteness as she is still very much confused about their situation. Nathan is supposed to tell her sorry or something, but instead he just watches her lips. Before he knows it, hers was on his. 



He feels his hands doing what he doesn’t tell them to do. He starts nagging at the waist of her shorts, pulling it down slightly. His body moves and backs her up towards the bed. He watches her face, and be careful to see if she is going to stop him. After finding the waist of her shorts and panties, he pulls her entire bottom clothings down to her ankles. There is a moment where he stands up, and looks at his roommate’s confused face and down as her opening legs. He knows what he wants to do.



He drops down to his knees and grips her thick thighs pushing it down. He stares hungrily at her wet cunt. She is so exposed to him in this position. Her inner folds are slightly opened, showing off her sweet pink pussy. She looks wonderful at this angle. He slowly traces his tongue against her, twirling it around her clit. Her back arches and she lets out some muffled moans as he focuses on pleasuring her. He licks and stops to suck her inner lips. And then back to licking for a while. As he moves down her slit to her opening, he tastes the flowing juices. It is sweet and so erotic, keep him wanting more. He sticks his tongue in and out, feeling her contractions and the flowing wetness. They won’t need any lube at that point.



He can’t stand watching all her juices go to waste. He stands up and takes a good look at her. Chloe has her eyes closed, her mouth slightly open, gasping. She never looks so good to him. He bends down, kissing her as her tongue hastily licks his lips, trying to taste herself. Nathan drops his pants down quickly, letting his hard cock free. It perks up excitedly. He waits a little bit, kissing her more and caressing her boobs from under her shirt. With one hand on her breast and the other on the bed, he kneels on the mattress and slowly rubs his dick on her slit. The moist and hot cunt makes his dick pulses in anticipation. He rubs her lips, feeling her letting out gasps. Then she opens her eyes, staring at him, and murmurs “Please.” 



Nathan can’t wait anymore, he pushes his way inside her, watching her eyes roll back as she knocks her head back. He starts moving hurriedly, to get more of her. Her inside throbs and hugs his dick so tightly, making it pulses. He starts moving in hard and slow, each time pushing her down the mattress. He carefully watches her tits shake each time he pushes. He starts moving faster, picking up his speed until their bodies seem to be moving in a rhythm. Nathan closes his eyes and knocks his head back, feeling each of his roommate's grip. 



Her legs are wrapped around his hips, holding him tight. Her nails are digging into his shoulders. Her moans fill his room and all he can feel is the sloppiness of their body. “I never knew you are so amazing,” he smiles, staring at Chloe's lewd face. He hugs her waist, pulls her close, and start humping even faster.



 He is getting close and his dick pulses faster. Before he even knows it, he feels the wave of pleasure through his shaft. He lets out a huge groan and releases his cum inside of Chloe. It was his biggest load yet. When he pulls out, a stream of semen flows out of her throbbing pussy. He stands up quickly, puts a blanket over Chloe who is still panting, and leaves to take a shower.
